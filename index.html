        <br><h4>igniteFAIR began in 2014 as a way to help students gather information about the hundreds of non-profit, youth-run, and
        volunteer organizations from across Canada that provide opportunities for anyone to get involved. igniteFAIR will give you an
        opportunity to speak with representatives from different organizations about programs, campaigns and anything else that may help
        you make a decision about which organization(s) you would like to get involved with, as well as find inspiration and start feeling
        empowered to take action. igniteFAIR is also an event where people will be motivated by amazing speakers and performers, all passionate
        about taking action and igniting change within the local and international community.</h4>
        <br><h4>Each organization has its own booth, staffed with representatives who can answer your questions and provide additional
        materials on how you can volunteer. The two-day summit has attracted attention from across Canada, and hundreds of people will be
        in attendance at the first fair in Richmond Hill, Ontario (igniteFAIR Greater Toronto Area). It is our hope that we are able to
        ignite the passion in people to get involved and create change in their communities.</h4>

        <br><h4>Pledges for Change is an international youth-led, non-profit organization and movement that aims to
        engage and empower people across Canada and around the world to become the leaders of tomorrow. As the largest
        non-profit organization of its kind in Canada, they inspire people to take one action in support of a local or
        global cause every two months that is featured. For each pledge to action made on their website, a dollar will
        be donated to a registered charity in support of the featured cause.</h4>
        <br><h4>Pledges for Change is a catalyst for change, giving people the inspiration and the support they need to make a positive
        impact in their communities.</h4>
        <br><h4>Founded in 2013 by Canada Top 20 Under 20 Recipient Brennan Wong, their goal is to empower thousands of people around the
        globe to make a difference in their communities, just by simply committing to take action. They believe that we can all work together to conquer
        what was once impossible and ultimately change our world for the better!</h4>
